  <article class="post-content">
  <h2 id="contacting-staff">Contacting Staff</h2>

<p>The best way to contact me is by email. There is an office phone as
well, but I check my email much much more frequently than I can check my
voicemail, since I don’t come in each day. I try to answer all emails on
the day I receive them. I reserve the right to not check email at all on
the weekends, however.</p>

<p>Note that I am teaching three courses with multiple sections: it may make
things go more smoothly if you remind me which class of mine you are taking
the first few times you email me.</p>

<p>We will also be setting up a discussion board on Piazza. The course
staff will check this on a regular basis. It is best to ask questions
here first, since other students may have the same questions, and
there’s always someone who loves answering questions.</p>

<h2 id="regrades">Regrades</h2>

<p>When you get back an assignment or an exam, check the solutions
carefully. If you think a problem should be regraded, turn in your
assignment with a <em>written</em> description of why you think you should get
more points. You have two weeks from when an assignment or exam was
returned to ask for a regrade.</p>

<p>Note well: a regrade is to correct an inaccurate grading. It is not a
means of “rolling the dice” again to see if you get a better score.</p>

<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2>

<p>Extensions are not given in this course.  If you have a valid reason
for missing an assignment, I can excuse you from it.  An exception is
for exams; conflict exams can be arranged if you are unable to make the
original time.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>The labs are given so that you can learn the material and study for the
exams. Therefore, if it helps you learn the material better, you may
work with other students who are taking this course with you. You must
turn in your own copy of the lab.</p>

<p>We will not check for this, but Bad Things will happen if you simply
copy and hand in another students lab, or split the coding among
yourselves and collate the results. If you try that, you won’t learn
anything, and you’ll be in trouble on the exam, since the exam material
will be influenced greatly by the labs.</p>

<p><strong>Projects</strong> Project work must be done on your own, or with your project
team, as the case may be. You may discuss aspects of your project with
your classmates, but the code must be your own. If you are found to have
collaborated with another project team, you will fail the project, and
at the discretion of the instructor, fail the course.</p>

<p><strong>Quizzes/Exams</strong> If you are caught collaborating and/or cheating on an
exam, you will receive an E for the course, and will be reported to the
department and the college.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Grades will be given according to the following cutoffs. Roughly
speaking, a C should represent being able to recognize the right answer,
and an A should represent being able to generate the right answer.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Grade</th>
      <th>Points</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>85</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>70</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>55</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>D</td>
      <td>40</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>E</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Historically, the class average for CS 331 has been near the A/B cutoff.</p>

<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>

<p>We do not have an official required textbook for data structures.  We will
be using the course notes for that.  We do require a book on <sc>Clojure</sc>,</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Joy of Clojure, 2nd edition</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, see the resources page for some on-line tutorials and texts.</p>

<h2 id="the-hunt">The Hunt</h2>

<p>As a teacher, I want to produce high-quality materials for my students.  I also want to encourage my
students to study the material, do all the readings… the normal things that professors go on
about.</p>

<p>As students, you want to study (at least, in principle), and you want to get good grades. You would
also like the professor to produce high-quality materials for you to use in your studies. Oh, and
you wouldn’t mind an opportunity to score a few extra-credit points on the side.</p>

<p>This is where the Hunt comes in. You are invited to submit corrections to typos and errors you find
in the course materials. The first person to do so gets extra credit for it!</p>

<h3 id="domain-of-the-hunt">Domain of the Hunt</h3>

<p>The domain of the Hunt is the question database, the slides and handouts
for lectures, the web site, and any guides/textbooks that the instructor produces.</p>

<p>Other things, like emails, etc., are <strong>not</strong> part of the Hunt.</p>

<p>To submit an error for extra credit, you must post to the Piazza group.  This is for
a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it establishes who found the problem first</li>
  <li>it communicates quickly to other students that there is a problem (and prevents me from
having to field 20 duplicate submissions — yes, this has happened before)</li>
  <li>if the answer is, in fact, correct, it enables me to give an explanation as to why.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="credit">Credit</h3>

<p>A “typo” is a presentation-related error. This could include misspelled words, broken
URLs, incorrect dates, that kind of thing. You will receive one point of extra credit for each typo
you point out, subject to the following restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You get a maximum of one typo credit per question in the database,
and per lecture slide.</li>
  <li>Animation sequences will be considered one slide for these purposes.</li>
  <li>Handouts, guides, and textbooks do not have this limitation.</li>
  <li>Propagation errors will be counted as two errors total. (e.g., the
wrong base of a URL throughout a document, a word misspelled
consistently, a running example where an error is copied from
example to example; all will be counted as two errors.)</li>
  <li>Errors in repackaged versions of materials (e.g. 4-up versions of
slides) will not be counted for both files, just for the source.
Pointing out that the 4-up is not the same set as the original
counts as typo, though.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will receive up to three points of extra credit for each correction
you make.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A “correction” involves a course-content related error, and must not
simply be a mistyped sentence, but be an actual error in the process
of solving the problem. If an error does not meet these
qualifications, then it is still considered a typo.</li>
  <li>You will get three points if you find an incorrect solution to a
question in the database, and show me the correct solution.</li>
  <li>You will get one point if you find an incorrect solution to a
question in the database, and point it out to me.</li>
  <li>This point breakdown also applies to other materials.</li>
  <li>Only one correction can be submitted per question in the database or
lecture slide, but other materials are not limited.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some global maximums….</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may get a maximum of 30 extra credit points for the semester.
Currently that would be worth 3% of the grade.</li>
  <li>The instructor will have the final say as far as the value and
validity of corrections received.</li>
</ul>
