<h2 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h2>

<p>The purpose of this course is to give you a working knowledge of the
fundamentals of programming languages.  Programming languages are mathematical
objects, and implementations of different models of computation.  By the end
of the course, you will understand these models and how to turn them into
languages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compare the major classes of programming languages, describing their
techniques, features, and styles.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate how to select an apporpriate programming language for a
particular task.</li>
  <li>Read a formal specification of a language and implement it.</li>
  <li>Use four powerful ideas:
    <ul>
      <li>Recursion</li>
      <li>Abstraction</li>
      <li>Transformation</li>
      <li>Unification</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The emphasis is on learning the theory, and using it in an implementation.</p>

<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>

<p>Typically there will be between six and eight programming assignments,
called <em>machine problems</em> (MPs). They will be released approximately one
every two weeks.</p>

<p>There will also be in-class assignments / activities. These will not be
graded, but will be checked for adequate participation. These activities
collectively will be worth 10% of your final grade. They are expected to
be done in class, but will be accepted by the beginning of class one
week later.</p>

<p>Note that the particulars of the assignments (such as due dates, and
even number) may change as course circumstances dictate.</p>

<p>The MPs, regardless of number, are collectively worth 20% of the course
grade.</p>

<p><strong>Late assignments are not accepted under any circumstances.</strong> If you have a
legitimate reason for missing an assignment, it is possible to have it
excused. Occasionally the instructor may extend the due date of an
assignment for the entire class, but this is rare.</p>

<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>

<p>We will have one midterm (Thursday, June 25)
and one final exam (Thursday, July 23). They are
each worth 25%.</p>

<p>The final exam is cumulative. If the final exam score is better than a
particular midterm score, then the final exam will replace your midterm
score as well. So if you get 50% on exam 1, a 75% on exam 2, and 70% on
the final, we will grade it as if you got 70% on exam 1. But, if you got
70% on each midterm and 50% on the final, then the scores stand as-is.</p>

<p>We can implement the algorithm in <sc>Haskell</sc> like this:</p>

<p><code>
exam_1_score = max exam_1 final_exam
exam_2_score = max exam_2 final_exam
</code></p>

<h2 id="disability-resources">Disability Resources</h2>

<p>Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented
disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a
letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and
make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible. The Center for
Disability Resources is located in the Life Sciences Building, room 218,
312-567-5744 or <a href="http://mccarthy.cs.iit.edu/cs440/disabilities@iit.edu">disabilities@iit.edu</a>.</p>
