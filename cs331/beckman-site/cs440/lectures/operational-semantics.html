      <h2> Operational Semantics </h2>
<p> Tuesday, June 30, 2015 </p>


<p>In order to be rigorous in our understanding of programming languages, it helps to be
able to state precisely the meaning of a program.  The branch of mathematics dealing
with this is called *semantics.  There are many kinds of semantics.</p>

<p>The semantics we will talk about today is called <em>operational semantics</em>, also called
<em>transition semantics</em>.  The idea with this semantics is that we model what one step
of computation looks like, and use that to describe the meaning of a program.</p>

<p>One very important concept that comes up with this form is the <em>Church-Rosser theorem</em>.</p>
