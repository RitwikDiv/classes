Goodbye Beckman,

        For those reading and who also know of Mattox Beckman, he left IIT 
        after the summer term of 2015. The CS department will 
        truly never be the same. Luckily, I preserved his website
        for anyone who stumbles upon this repsository.
        
        [update] I moved his files to their own respective repository.
