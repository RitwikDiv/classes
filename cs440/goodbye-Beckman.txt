Goodbye Beckman,

        I wish I would've had you for this course. For those
        reading and who also know of Mattox Beckman, he left IIT 
        after the summer term of 2015. The CS department will 
        truly never be the same. Luckily, I preserved his website
        for anyone who stumbles upon this repsository.
