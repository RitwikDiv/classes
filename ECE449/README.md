This is a circuit simulator for a fake language called EasyVL, a made up subset of Verilog. I got bogged down with 3 final projects being due at the same time so the final stage of the product was not fully finished. I'm pretty disappointed, but I plan on taking my new knowledge of verilog to write my own simulator in the near future (Winter project) to make up for the fact I was unable to finish this. I'd also like to actually use class design. I basically implemented it in C using only structs while utilizing libraries in C++.
