\begin{enumerate}
	\item Exercises (1-1) and (1-2)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The following definitions are valid because the constants are declared and instantiated correctly. This will compile and run without errors.
		\item The declaration is not valid. It will produce a compiler error saying \texttt{invalid operands of types `const char [6]' and `const char [8]' to binary 'operator+'}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item The associativity is from right to left. In this case, d would be assigned to c, which then c is assigned to b, which then b is assigned to a. This will produce a result of 3 3 3 3. The side effects of this is that the original values of a, b, and c do not matter; only the original value of d does, since that is what is assigned to each variable.
	\item We can infer that it returns a double
\end{enumerate}
